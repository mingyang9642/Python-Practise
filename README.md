# Python Practise – Assessment 1

# Introduction
This practise is an intro to Python programming. The course provides a detailed procedure for me to learn how to use Variables, Containers, Branching Loops and Functions to make models and agents, in order to build a quite sophisticated programme.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7 environment, which can be established by installing Anaconda 3 on the computer.
     Link: anaconda.com/distribution

# Files/Directories
There are four directories in this repository, three of which stands for steps to final programme, thereby the final one is the programme included with final code. Among these directories, each of them contains one “Agent.py” file and one “Model.py” file, since “Agent” is an inset to “Model”. Also, an “in.txt” file is included, which is for I/O.

# Running the test
- How to run?
Running this programme is quite simple. Just download the whole “Final One - GUI” directory to local drive, double-click the folder. Now the key is to hold onto SHIFT button, right click at blank space, and open the POWERSHELL (Win10). Type “Python model.py” into the command, the programme runs.

- What will it be like when it is running?
A good display of animation running in a window shows at last. The animation is about a certain number of sheep (points) running on green grass (raster with evaluation data) and eating them (colour of the raster fades gradually).
